					<h2>The History of Ruby</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (more affectionately
					known as Matz) in Japan starting in 1993. Matz essentially
					kept Ruby to himself until 1995 when he released it to the
					public. Ruby quickly gained a following in Matz's home
					country of Japan in the following years, and finally gained
					recognition in the rest of the programming world beginning
					in the year 2000. From that point on Ruby has grown in
					popularity, particularly because of the popularity of the
					Ruby on Rails web application development framework.

					<h2>What is Ruby?</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Ruby is an object-oriented interpreted scripting language.
					When we say it is interpreted we mean to say that the Ruby
					source code is compiled by an interpreter at the point of
					execution (similar in this regard to JavaScript and PHP).
					This contrasts with compiled languages such as C or C++
					where the code is pre-compiled into a binary format targeted
					to run on a specific brand of microprocessor. There are
					advantages and disadvantages to being an interpreted
					language. A disadvantage is speed. Because the source code
					has to be interpreted at runtime this means that it runs
					slower than an equivalent compiled application. A secondary
					concern for some is the fact that anyone who uses your
					application will also be able to see the source code. In the
					world of open source this is less of a problem than it used
					to be, but for some proprietary applications this might
					prove to be unacceptable. The primary advantage of
					interpreted languages is that they are portable across
					multiple operating system platforms and hardware
					architectures. A compiled application, on the other hand,
					will only run on the operating system and hardware for which
					it was compiled. For example, you can take a Ruby
					application and run it without modification on an Intel
					system running Linux, an Intel system running Windows, an
					Intel system running Mac OS X or even a PowerPC system
					running Mac OS or Linux. To do this with a C or C++
					application you would need to compile the code on each of
					the 5 different systems and make each binary image
					available. With Ruby you just supply the source code.
					Another advantage of being interpreted is that we can write
					and execute Ruby code in real-time directly in the Ruby
					interpreter. For those who like to try things out in real
					time (and not everyone does), this is an invaluable feature.

					<h2>Install Ruby</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					If you cannot compile your own Ruby, and you do not want to
					use a third-party tool, you can use your system’s package
					manager to install Ruby. Some members of the Ruby community
					feel that you should avoid package managers to install Ruby
					and that you should use dedicated tools instead. It is
					possible that major package managers will install older Ruby
					versions instead of the latest release. To use the latest
					Ruby release, check that the package name matches its
					version number.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Instructions for Linux:</strong></p>
				<ul class="no-style">
					<li>
						To check if you already have Ruby installed, use the
						following command in your terminal: <code>ruby -v</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						If an error pops up (or nothing at all!), it means you
						don't have it installed yet. Follow the instructions
						bellow:
					</li>
					<ul class="no-style">
						<li>
							Using apt:
							<code>$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Using yum:
							<code>$ sudo yum install ruby</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Using snap:
							<code>$ sudo snap install ruby --classic</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							To clone the whole Ruby source tree:
							<code>
								$ git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git
							</code>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Popular Tools</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>RubyMine</strong></p>
				<p>
					Produce high-quality code more efficiently, thanks to
					first-class support for Ruby and Rails, JavaScript and
					CoffeeScript, ERB and HAML, CSS, Sass and Less, and more.
					Take advantage of the language specific-aware syntax & error
					highlighting, code formatting, code completion, and quick
					documentation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use smart search to jump to any class, file or symbol, or
					even any IDE action or tool window. It only takes one click
					to switch to the declaration, super method, test, usages,
					implementation, and more. Enjoy super fast navigation in
					your Rails project with an MVC-based project view and model,
					class, and gem dependencies diagrams.

					<h2>Frameworks</h2>

				<p><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></p>
				<p>
					Learning to build a modern web application is daunting. Ruby
					on Rails makes it much easier and more fun. It includes
					everything you need to build fantastic applications, and you
					can learn it with the support of our large, friendly
					community.
				</p>
				<p>
					You’ve probably already used many of the applications that
					were built with Ruby on Rails: Basecamp, HEY, GitHub,
					Shopify, Airbnb, Twitch, SoundCloud, Hulu, Zendesk, Square,
					Cookpad. Those are just some of the big names, but there are
					literally hundreds of thousands of applications built with
					the framework since its release in 2004.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Padrino</strong></p>
				<p>
					Padrino is a ruby framework built upon the excellent Sinatra
					Web Library. Sinatra is a DSL for creating simple web
					applications in Ruby quickly and with minimal effort. This
					framework tries to make it as fun and easy as possible to
					code more advanced web applications by building upon the
					Sinatra philosophies and foundations.
